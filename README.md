# CarOccupancyDetection
The space-detecting program is created using the SOTA **YOLOv8** model. The model was trained on 1,300 images with their respective sizes and annotations in 100 epochs. The obtained model is named as "best.pt". This program is trained to work on any parking lot. However, the user will have to obtain the coordinates of the slots manually, using the 'draw.py' program, which uses the mouse event of OpenCV to draw rectangles. In this case, the "slots.json" file consists of the coordinates of the parking lot slots in "carPark.mp4".
